# Krishi Suvidha Comprehensive Feature Implementation Plan

## Progress Update
- Phase-1 frontend-backend wiring completed for: Weather, SoilHealth, DiseaseDetection, LocalResources, Marketplace.
- API base configured in src/services/api.js (http://localhost:5000, paths normalized to /api/*).
- Server running with 24 endpoints; SQLite DB initialized and logging enabled.
- Next focus: complete remaining components and advanced features listed below.

## Backend
- Create REST API endpoints for:
  - Soil analysis
  - Disease detection (image upload and AI analysis)
  - Weather data (enhance existing endpoint with real API integration)
  - Marketplace (buyers listing, crop listing)
  - Water availability
  - Crop advice based on soil, weather, water
  - Crop diversification suggestions
  - Seasonal disease and pest alerts
  - Quality monitoring of crops
  - Poultry and cattle management
  - Drone services for organic pesticide spraying
  - Government portal linking and awareness
  - Cold storage chain management (PPP model)
  - E-mandis for best pricing
  - Transport sharing and logistics
  - Vehicle tracking with GPS
  - Feedback and review system
  - SMS/USSD support for low internet users
  - AI chatbot for query resolution
  - Market price tracking with govt portal data
  - Volunteer coordination platform
  - Group farming support

- Implement data models and database integration (e.g., MongoDB or SQL)
- Integrate external APIs where needed (weather, market prices, govt portals)
- Implement authentication and authorization if required

## Frontend
- Update existing components to call backend APIs and display real data
- Create new components for missing features (alerts, videos, chatbots, etc.)
- Implement UI for notifications, seasonal alerts, and disease/pest warnings
- Add video reels for farmer education and demos
- Implement SMS/USSD interface integration (if feasible)
- Add multi-language support for local languages

## Integration & Testing
- Connect frontend and backend APIs
- Write unit and integration tests for backend endpoints
- Write component and integration tests for frontend
- Perform end-to-end testing of all features
- Optimize performance and usability

## Progress Update: Features 6, 7, 8, 10, 11 implemented

Completed in this iteration:
- Backend refinements:
  - GET /api/disease-alerts now includes postHarvestAlerts covering storage pests/diseases and mitigations (after-cultivation alerts).
  - GET /api/vermicompost now includes organicPesticides recipes (including cattle/poultry waste based) and droneSprayGuidelines.
- Frontend services added:
  - src/services/alertsService.js
  - src/services/qualityMonitoringService.js
  - src/services/livestockService.js
  - src/services/vermicompostService.js
  - src/services/droneService.js
- Frontend components and routes added:
  - Disease & Pest Alerts: src/components/DiseaseAlerts.js, route /alerts
  - Quality Monitoring: src/components/QualityMonitoring.js, route /quality-monitoring
  - Livestock & Poultry: src/components/Livestock.js, route /livestock
  - Vermicompost & Organic Pesticides: src/components/Vermicompost.js, route /vermicompost
  - Drone Services: src/components/DroneServices.js, route /drone-services
  - App routes wired in src/App.js; navigation links added in src/components/Header.js
  - “More Quick Access” cards added in src/components/Home.js

What this delivers against requested items:
- 6. After cultivation alerts for seasonal disease and pests → Provided via /alerts page sourcing backend’s currentAlerts, seasonalForecast, and new postHarvestAlerts.
- 7. Quality monitoring team (segregating quality tied to pricing) → Provided via QualityMonitoring page using /api/quality-monitoring.
- 8. Poultry and cattle beneficial for sustainable farming → Provided via Livestock page using /api/livestock with integrated sustainability notes.
- 10. Vermicompost suggesting processes for pesticides from poultry/cattle excreta and organics → Added recipes to backend and UI in Vermicompost page.
- 11. Using drones for sprinkling organic pesticides → Dedicated Drone Services page + drone guidelines surfaced in Vermicompost.

Next steps (recommendations):
1) Run and smoke test
   - Backend: cd server && npm install && npm start
   - Frontend: npm install && npm start
   - Verify new routes: /alerts, /quality-monitoring, /livestock, /vermicompost, /drone-services
2) i18n labels for new pages (Punjabi/English toggle support) and content localization.
3) UX polish: validations, empty states, loading skeletons, and mobile tuning.
4) Tests
   - Add server tests for amended endpoints (disease-alerts/vermicompost).
   - Add UI tests for new components’ happy/error paths.
5) Optional integrations
   - Persist user inputs (location, cropType) to improve defaults across pages.
   - Hook alerts to Weather or CropAdvice context for smarter recommendations.

Marking phase complete for requested items 6, 7, 8, 10, 11. Further priorities can be scheduled in the next iteration.
